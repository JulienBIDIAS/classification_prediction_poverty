# Prediction of poverty using mobile phone Data (CDR) 

These notebooks describe how to construct a composite poverty indicator and a multidimensional poverty indicator for households. They then demonstrate how mobile phone data and supervised learning methods can aid in predicting these indicators. Mobile data is a highly rich and diverse source that can contribute to enhancing well-being issues through optimal and precise targeting. While field surveys often organized by institutions allow for an understanding of this phenomenon, new data sources can also be useful for research, not only in poverty analysis but also in various other fields. Machine learning methods, combined with mobile data, can be used, for example, to provide alerts for climate changes or predict indicators that are usually obtained through field surveys. In summary, these new data sources can help reduce costs and represent a vast field for research.
